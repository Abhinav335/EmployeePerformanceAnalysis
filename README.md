# Employee Performance Analysis Model

## Overview

This project is a machine learning model built in Python for analyzing employee performance. The goal is to provide insights into the factors influencing employee performance and help organizations make informed decisions to improve overall productivity.

## Features

- Predictive Analysis: The model employs machine learning algorithms to predict employee performance based on various input features.
- Data Visualization: Visual representations of key performance indicators to facilitate easy interpretation of results.
- Customization: Easily adaptable for different datasets and organizations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, etc. (Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/praneykalra16/employee-performance-analysis.git
    cd employee-performance-analysis
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Prepare your data:**

    - Place your dataset in the `data` directory.
    - Update the `config.yaml` file with the appropriate configurations for your dataset.
